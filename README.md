# My MCP Remote Server

This is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that exposes two tools:

cv_chat – answers questions about my CV

send_mail – sends emails using the Resend API

It’s deployed at:

https://my-mcp-server.sageethhimachala.workers.dev/sse

You can connect to it from Claude Desktop or any MCP-compatible client.

## 📦 Installation

No installation is needed if you’re only using the hosted server URL.
If you want to run it locally for development:

git clone https://github.com/sageethhimachala/my-mcp-server

cd my-mcp-server

npm install

npm run dev # or your start command

## 🔗 Connecting to Claude Desktop

In Claude Desktop, open Settings → Developer → Edit Config, and add this to claude_desktop_config.json file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-mcp-remote-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://my-mcp-server.sageethhimachala.workers.dev/sse"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

This tells Claude Desktop to connect to the hosted MCP server.
After adding and saving the changes to the file, make sure to open Task Manager, end the “Claude Desktop” process, and then restart Claude Desktop.
